# Luminosity Arduino Sensor
>Status: Finishedâœ…

### It is a circuit that captures the luminosity in the location and according to the pre-settings tells the level on led, being:


+ Dark > ðŸŸ¢
+ Low light > ðŸŸ¡
+ Lots of light > ðŸ”´

### The wires represents:
+ ðŸ”´ the passage of 5V power.
+ ðŸŸ¢ the direct power flow from the Arduino.
+ âš« the passage of energy to ground.
+ ðŸŸ£ the passage of information to the Arduino.
